# Hue Desktop

## Description

HueDesktop is a Qt application (written for my own personal use) that can control Philips Hue lights via the Philips Hue Bridge. Users can control the color and brightness of the lights, as well as switch between several preset lighting scenes.


HueDesktop was written for personal use, and as such, will *not* work on any machine other than my own for the time being. In the future, Bridge discovery may be implemented, however, this project mainly serves as a pet project to flex my muscles in Qt/QML, as well as providing me with a tool to control my lights from my desktop.
